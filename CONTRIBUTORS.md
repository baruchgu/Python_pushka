‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- The project was done solely by me
- Even those, many of the code and ideas were copied from several README files of [Tal](https://github.com/mendelsontal) in his GitHub projects. :+1: Thanks ü§ù
- Generally, Tal and I do collaborate on the problems and ideas during the home-works
- Both of us prefer to work on whole the practice task to train all the relevant aspects
