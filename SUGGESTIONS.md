# Suggestions

### Project
GREAT WORK !!!

### README
- Wonderful structure and greatly designed.
- Loved the links to code validation
- Despite your claim that you are sole contributor, github shows that Tal Mendenson has provided input, thus you better give him credit on your readme file.
  - Also, write down who did what
- Preferred to use TASK and CONTRIBUTORS (there is a typo in file name as well)

### SCRIPTS
- there is a typo in script3.py => anem
- great use of delta !!!
